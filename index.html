		<div class = "allergy-name-mobile">Eggs &#x1F373;</div>
		<div class = "bio-mobile">An international sweetheart, Eggs can be found in your favorite dessert or baked goods. But don‚Äôt be fooled by her sweet tastes, Eggs also has a savory side.  Catch her in your next brunch entree‚Äîshe‚Äôs a guaranteed headliner. <p></p> <br> &#x26A1; <b> Warning:</b> most severe of all the allergies &#x26A1; </br></div>
			<p></p>
		<div class = "allergy-name-mobile">Seafood &#x1F41F;</div>
		<div class = "bio-mobile">Something smells fishy... must be Seafood! He‚Äôs the prankster of the group and can take many forms, including <b>sushi, shrimp, oysters,  salmon, and many more</b>. A good rule of thumb: if it comes from the ocean (and it‚Äôs not seaweed), it‚Äôs a no-go. <p></p> <br>&#x26A1; <b> &nbsp; Warning:</b> very severe allergy &#x26A1; </br></div>
			<p></p>
		<div class = "allergy-name-mobile">Nuts &#x1F330;</div>
		<div class = "bio-mobile">With veganism and healthy eating blowing up in the Bay Area, most people are nuts about Nuts! Included in Avery‚Äôs Allergies are most <b>tree nuts (cashews, almonds, pecans, walnuts, pistachios, etc)</b> but don‚Äôt include peanuts (which are a legume, not a nut, if you wanna get technical).  <p></p> <br> ü•ú&ensp; Peanuts, pine nuts, coconuts, and macadamia nuts are <b>not</b> included as an allergy, which means they‚Äôre fine for Avery to eat!</br></div>
			<p></p>	
		<div class = "allergy-name-mobile">Beef &#x1F969;</div>
		<div class = "bio-mobile">Yeah, we‚Äôre not really sure if he‚Äôs a real Allergy, or just an Intolerance. He was one of the last Allergies  to emerge, and usually shows himself in undercooked beef, and is especially bad in <b>steak and burgers.</b> <p></p> <br>&#x1F404;&ensp; Assess on a case by case basis, but usually it's no.</br></div>
			<p></p>
			<div class = "allergy-name-mobile">Avocado &#x1F951;</div>
		<div class = "bio-mobile">The cool older cousin to Banana and Kiwi, some might call Avocado's addition to the group nepotism‚Äîbut it was really just fate. He has fans across the globe and is known for his hit, "Guacamole."</br></div>
			<p></p>
		<div class = "allergy-name-mobile">Banana &#x1F34C;</div>
		<div class = "bio-mobile">It‚Äôs unclear whether the Banana is an Allergy or just a really intense dislike, but either way, he‚Äôs part of the group to stay. <br></br> </div>
			<p></p>
		<div class = "allergy-name-mobile">Kiwi &#x1F95D;</div>
		<div class = "bio-mobile">Kiwi is oh-so-sweet, but she packs a real allergic punch, along with her Chinese cousin, <b>Dragonfruit</b>. Fun fact: last consumed in 2008!<br></br></div>
			<p></p>
		<div class = "allergy-name-mobile">Avery üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</div>
		<div class = "bio-mobile">The only human in the group. Has way too many Allergies and thought she'd have some fun with them for once.<br></br></div>
