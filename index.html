		<div class = "allergy-name-mobile">Eggs &#x1F373;</div>
		<div class = "bio-mobile">An international sweetheart, Eggs can be found in your favorite dessert or baked goods. But don‚Äôt be fooled by her sweet tastes, Eggs also has a savory side.  Catch her in your next brunch entree-- she‚Äôs a guaranteed headliner. <p></p> <br> &#x26A1; <b> Warning:</b> most severe of all the allergies &#x26A1; </br></div>
			<p></p>
		<div class = "allergy-name-mobile">Seafood &#x1F41F;</div>
		<div class = "bio-mobile">Something smells fishy... must be Seafood! He‚Äôs the prankster of the group and can take many forms, including <b>sushi, lobster, oysters,  salmon, and many more</b>. A good rule of thumb: if it comes from the ocean (and it‚Äôs not seaweed), it‚Äôs a no-go. <p></p> <br>&#x26A1; <b> Warning:</b> very severe allergy &#x26A1; </br></div>
			<p></p>
		<div class = "allergy-name-mobile">Nuts &#x1F330;</div>
		<div class = "bio-mobile">With veganism and healthy eating blowing up in the Bay Area, most people are nuts about Nuts! Included in Avery‚Äôs Allergies are most <b>tree nuts (cashews, almonds, pecans, walnuts, pistachios, etc)</b> but don‚Äôt include peanuts (which are a legume, not a nut).  <p></p> <br> ü•ú   Peanuts, pine nuts, coconuts, and macadamia nuts are <b>not</b> included as an allergy, which means they‚Äôre fine for Avery to eat!</br></div>
			<p></p>	
		<div class = "allergy-name-mobile">Beef &#x1F969;</div>
		<div class = "bio-mobile">Yeah, we‚Äôre not really sure if he‚Äôs a real Allergy, or just an Intolerance. He was one of the last Allergies  to emerge, and usually shows himself in undercooked beef, and is especially bad in <b>steak and burgers.</b> <br>&#x1F404;  Assess on a case by case basis, but usually it's no.</br></div>
			<p></p>
		<div class = "allergy-name-mobile">Banana &#x1F34C;</div>
		<div class = "bio-mobile">It‚Äôs unclear whether the Banana is an Allergy or just a really intense dislike, but either way, he‚Äôs part of the group to stay. <br></br> </div>
			<p></p>
		<div class = "allergy-name-mobile">Kiwi &#x1F95D;</div>
		<div class = "bio-mobile">Kiwi is oh-so-sweet, but she packs a real allergic punch, along with her Chinese cousin, Dragonfruit. Fun fact: last consumed in 2008!<br></br></div>
			<p></p>
		<div class = "allergy-name-mobile">Avery üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</div>
		<div class = "bio-mobile">The only human in the group. Has way too many Allergies and thought she'd have some fun with them for once.<br></br></div>
